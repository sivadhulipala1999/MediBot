Fine-tuning is more relevant than ever before since we have the power of taming large language models to answer questions specific to our domains. I built this notebook to gain a better understanding of the current landscape of fine-tuning, specifically LoRA, and share my knowledge with everyone else! 

In the notebook, you will find a fine-tuned TinyLlama model, that answers medical questions. MedQuAD was the dataset used for fine-tuning. Please consider this as a small scale proof-of-concept.
